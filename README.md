  ### Description
  A full stack notes application that accepts user input and saves it to a db. Notes can be reviewed after being saved.
  
  ### Installation
  Launched through Heroku but can be forked on github then run npm i in the terminal to download the dependencies, and use your local host to view it in the browser or another api viewer.
  
  ### Usage
  Through software similar to insomia or run on the browser through local host.
  
  ### Disclaimer
  The only original code I have created is this readme file, apiroutes.js, htmlroutes.js, and server.js. Aside from some minor changes made to some of the other files, everything not mentioned above is copied from [this Repo](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).


  ### Contributing
  The only additional functionality I would reccomend is a delete function so make the trash can icons work in the html but other than that, none.
  
  ### Testing
  No testing, just trial an error.
